# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Status

This appears to be a newly initialized project with minimal structure. The repository currently contains only a VS Code workspace file (`expert agentic platform.code-workspace`) and no source code, dependencies, or documentation.

## Current Structure

- `expert agentic platform.code-workspace`: VS Code workspace configuration file

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty project, development commands will need to be established based on the technology stack chosen. Once the project structure is defined, this section should be updated with:

- Installation/setup commands
- Build commands
- Test commands
- Linting commands
- Development server commands

## Architecture Notes

The project structure and architecture are yet to be defined. This section should be updated as the codebase develops to include:

- High-level system architecture
- Key design patterns and conventions
- Module organization principles
- Data flow patterns

## Next Steps for Development

1. Initialize the project with a chosen technology stack
2. Set up basic project structure and configuration files
3. Update this CLAUDE.md with specific commands and architectural guidance
